        "##Scenario\n",
        "Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user. To make it all easier for you, we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "the computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X's;\n",
        "the user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O's;\n",
        "the first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;\n",
        "all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1.\n",
        "the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;\n",
        "the program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;\n",
        "the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;\n",
        "don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Requirements\n",
        "Implement the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "the board should be stored as a three-element list, while each element is another three-element list (the inner lists represent rows) so that all of the squares may be accessed using the following syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "#####board[row][column]\n",
        "\n",
        "each of the inner list's elements can contain 'O', 'X', or a digit representing the square's number (such a square is considered free)\n",
        "the board's appearance should be exactly the same as the one presented in the example.\n",
        "implement the functions defined for you in the editor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawing a random integer number can be done by utilizing a Python function called randrange(). \n"
